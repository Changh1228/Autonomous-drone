# Autonomous Drone Project
This repository was created for a project course in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KTH (Sweden). The task to be solved in the project could be considered as an object search task constrained by having to pass a number of gates at known positions along the way. To assist the system in terms of localization there were a number of markers in the environment. These markers were ArUco markers of known size and known pose. The objects were traffic signs printed on paper. The aim was to navigate along the track defined by the gates while finding objects at the same time.
